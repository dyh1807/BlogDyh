The optimization of a compiler takes the most code in a modern compiler. Here is a note for optimization, which is take with llvm.

## Regular optimization
A list of optimization:  
1. mem2reg
2. Constant Propagation
3. dead code eliminate (dce)
4. Common subexpression elimination (CSE)
5. loop-invariant code motion (LICM)
6. ...

This post will focus on CSE and LICM
